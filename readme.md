# Supercell Redesigned

This is a personal project where I have redesigned the official Supercell website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to reimagine the site's layout and features, incorporating animations and a modern design while showcasing the popular games developed by Supercell.

## Features

- **Desktop/Laptop Only**: The website is designed specifically for desktop and laptop users. It is not currently optimized for mobile devices.
- **Interactive Navigation**: The navigation bar changes dynamically as you scroll through the page.
- **GSAP Animations**: Smooth scroll-triggered animations enhance the user experience.
- **Games Showcase**: Displays Supercell’s popular games with hover effects to reveal more information.
- **Office Locations**: A section dedicated to showing Supercell’s global offices.
- **Video Background**: Engaging full-screen video background on the homepage.
